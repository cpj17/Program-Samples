You can easily hide a folder using the Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows 11 with the `attrib` command.

### 🛠️ Here's how to do it:

1. **Open Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + S`, type `cmd`, and choose **Command Prompt**.
   - Right-click and select **Run as administrator** (optional, but can avoid permission issues).

2. **Use the `attrib` command**:
   ```bash
   attrib +h +s "C:\path\to\your\folder"
   ```

   🔹 `+h`: sets the folder as **hidden**  
   🔹 `+s`: marks it as a **system** folder, which makes it harder to show even with "Show hidden files" enabled

   ✅ Example:
   ```bash
   attrib +h +s "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\SecretFolder"
   ```

### 📂 To unhide the folder later:
```bash
attrib -h -s "C:\path\to\your\folder"
```
